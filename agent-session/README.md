# agent-session

`agent-session` normalizes local AI coding-agent transcripts into one portable
Rust session model. It discovers Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and
Kimi Code sessions, parses tokens/tools/files/prompts into a common IR, and
includes a matcher for linking live process trees back to agent sessions.

```rust
let sessions = agent_session::SessionCache::new()
    .discover_cached(25, std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));
```

## Scope

- Transcript/session discovery and parsing for local coding-agent logs.
- Token, tool, file, prompt, cwd, and timing normalization.
- Process-tree to session matching, including PID-to-session lookup.

`agent-session` intentionally does not export OpenTelemetry directly.
Applications such as AgentSight can map the IR to SQLite, OTEL, reports, or any
other telemetry backend they use.

## Publishing

The crate is published from the AgentSight release workflow before `agentsight`
itself, then `agentsight` depends on that published version. Publishing to
crates.io also makes the crate available to docs.rs and discoverable by the
unofficial lib.rs index.
